# Machine Learning Project 03: Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network 🧠

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of my third Machine Learning university project. The objective is to design and develop a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network. RBF networks are powerful models, highly effective for non-linear function approximation and complex pattern classification tasks.

## Project Details
The Jupyter Notebook (`PROJ_RBF_Final.ipynb`) demonstrates the complete architecture and training process of an RBF network. Unlike standard MLPs, this model utilizes radial basis functions (such as Gaussian functions) in its hidden layer. The workflow covers the essential steps of building an RBF network, including determining the centers and spreads of the RBF units, and computing the optimal weights for the output layer.

## Key Features
* **RBF Architecture:** Implementation of the hidden layer utilizing Gaussian radial basis functions to handle non-linear data boundaries.
* **Center Selection:** Strategic identification of optimal centers for the hidden neurons to maximize classification accuracy.
* **Training & Output Weights:** Efficient computation of the output layer weights.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the network's predictive performance and robustness using standard classification metrics.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy & Pandas** (Mathematical operations and data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Data visualization)
